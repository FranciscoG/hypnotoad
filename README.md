I wanted to see if I could recreate the sound and eyeball animations of Futurama's Hypnotoad using Processing.

First, I'm using P5js as a way to sketch things out because I already have the tools to work with. Then I'll convert over everything to Processing and test things out using the Arduino IDE.

**Audio:**

Thank you Scott Smitelli for doing that hard part for me: http://www.scottsmitelli.com/articles/everybody-imitates-hypnotoad

**Eyeball animations:**

This one is going to be much harder and still a work in process
